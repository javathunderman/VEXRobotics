# VEXRobotics - Legacy
Engineering Club code (ROBOTC)

This team 4001A's code for the VEX Robotics Competition during the 2017-2018 (In the Zone) season. This is written in ROBOTC and is designed to work with the ARM7 based Vex Cortex, which has been updated with the new VEX V5 package. 

Use at your own risk. Misusing this code may lead to problems such as persistent connection issues with VexNet keys, burning out Vex 393 motors, frying the Cortex PTCs and killing your ports, and a whole lot of stupid debugging.
