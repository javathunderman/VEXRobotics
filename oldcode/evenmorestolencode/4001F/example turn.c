Gyro Based Turns - Better
-This program instructs your robot to turn for the specified number of degrees in "degrees10".
-The first while loop moves the robot most of the way toward the specified number of degrees, exiting
 10 degrees (100 sensor counts) short of the goal.
-This program includes a second while loop which incorporates a specified error value to determine
 an acceptable range and allow the robot to turn more slowly toward its goal, eliminating much of
 the drift in the system.
-For best sensor results, clear out the gyro and manually configure it at the begging of the code.
-The Gyro is configured by default to provide values from 0 to -3600 for clockwise rotation,
 and 0 to 3600 for counter-clockwise rotation
